Discussion on the dm-alert-prod discussion channel

    Eric Bellm [12:13 AM]
    @ktl I am trying to understand better the outbound bandwidth budgeted for community brokers. I don’t see anything specific in the network sizing model--can you point me to where I might look?

    Kian-Tat Lim [12:15 AM]
    AFAIK, there is no specific modeling of that.  We assumed "bandwidth out to the Internet" would be either inexhaustible or funded by the other end.
    (for the purposes of the sizing model)

    Eric Bellm [12:18 AM]
    I guess I’m confused, then.  My understanding was that the number of full streams out was limited by bandwidth (either hardware or budget/$).  But you’re saying that’s not formally quantified?

    Kian-Tat Lim [12:18 AM]
    Yes, to my knowledge.  4 streams was a guess, and while I think some effort was made to back that up later, I don't think it has been formally documented.
    (For that matter, I don't think the number of community brokers is in LSE-61 or LSE-30)

    Eric Bellm [12:24 AM]
    Okay, that’s useful.  The context is that I’m trying to get out LDM-612, which describes selection of community brokers, and it looks a lot different if there are 4 slots or 10 (or 100…)

    Tim Jenness [12:25 AM]
    and what if some brokers are running at NCSA and some aren’t

    Eric Bellm [12:25 AM]
    I’d be happy just to understand the case of “all brokers are external to NCSA”

    Tim Jenness [12:26 AM]
    what is the full rate of the alert system? (Mbps or some unit) (edited)

    Eric Bellm [12:26 AM]
    I don’t think we know precisely to better than a factor of a few.  DPDD claims 100Mpbs

    Kian-Tat Lim [12:27 AM]
    We have max number of alerts per visit and size of an alert, but I'm not sure the full size has been re-estimated after all the changes to the contents.

    Eric Bellm [12:28 AM]
    Right, and the format matters somewhat too.

    Kian-Tat Lim [12:28 AM]
    Peak alerts/visit = 40K

    Maria Patterson [12:30 AM]
    ~300 Mbps from my stuff roughly

    Kian-Tat Lim [12:31 AM]
    We had thought that the alert packet would be dominated by the postage stamps (originally 20KB, now maybe 60KB but compressible to ~40KB).
    But a year of DiaSources could be substantial.
    And of course it comes out in bursts; the average can be determined but the maximum depends on how quickly you want to get the batch out.

    Eric Bellm [6:12 PM]
    @mgelman2 @mbutler From the NCSA side, do you have a sense of the limits on the outbound bandwidth (peak or sustained) we can devote to full
    streams to community brokers?  How would we make that determination?  This determines (with the alert stream volume) how many brokers we can
    select, and therefore feeds back into what the appropriate selection mechanism is.

    Michelle Butler [6:12 PM]
    joined #dm-alert-prod by invitation from Eric Bellm.

    Kian-Tat Lim [6:14 PM]
    I believe such a calculation was done relatively recently, but I'll let them speak for themselves.

    Dave Morris [6:06 AM]
    @ktl The Peak alerts/visit = 40K figure - is that in a document somewhere ?
    I'm part of the team developing a downstream community broker at Edinburgh, and we need to scope our system to be able to handle the peak
    alerts/visit rate from your system.

    Tim Jenness [6:09 AM]
    I’m not entirely sure. LPM-17 says 10,000 with a stretch goal of 100,000. transN is real alerts, not bogus ones.

    Eric Bellm [6:23 AM]
    In crowded regions I’d expect you could get >10k alerts from natural astrophysical variation, but the pipelines are not required to pass them
    but as the stretch goal indicates, it would be useful to do so if we could.
    I’m not sure I agree with @timj’s statement that transN does not include bogus.  We won’t put out any alerts we _know_ are bogus.
    What `transPurityMin` and `transCompletenessMin` allow us to do it make statements about the _aggregate_ contents of the alert stream (edited)

    Tim Jenness [6:31 AM]
    ok. I was sure that @ajc told me that 10k are the expected real alerts but maybe I misunderstood what he meant by “real”.

    Kian-Tat Lim [6:36 AM]
    Peak number is in LSE-81
    G71
    That's just for sizing; it doesn't say the pipelines can produce that many.

    Dave Morris [6:40 AM]
    That's useful to know.
    In a crowded region it won't be just one visit that is >10k, the peak could last for several visits in sequence all producing > 10k.
    If the peak lasts a long time and we are processing slower than they are being produced we could end up with a backlog. So ideally we
    should aim to be able to cope with the peak rate, or at least as close as we can within funding limits.
